    "Python proposes a standard style through one of its first Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP), [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008), and highlight the importance of readability in the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020).\n",

    "We may highlight some points:\n",

    "how you should structure your `import` statements,\n",
    "etc.\n",
    "Adhering to PEP8 makes it easier for other Python developers to read and understand your code,\n",
    "and to understand what their contributions should look like.\n",
    "The [PEP8 application and Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8)\n",
    "can check your code for compliance with PEP8.\n",
